# Project: Designer Shoes Recommendation System

  The online shoe market is for those users who are interested in shoes and like to explore the variety and collect new styles.
  
  We have created a web application where user can set the preferences and explore products. We have given a choice to user to see similar products based on two methods
  
  * **Method 1 - Using Product Name:**
    It uses the product description and brand to recommend similar shoes. Scikit learn library is used to process and build recommendation system.

  * **Method 2 - Using Product Image** 
    This method is based on the Annoy(Approximate nearest neighbors, oh-yeah!) by Spotify. It builds the nearest neighbors (we are building 20) for each product. These similarity     scores are used to recommend products.
