# Assignment 3 – Implementing Visual Search

  In this assignment we implemented visual search using FAISS, artistic similarity search and spotify annoy method.
  
  We have created 2 web-apps which show the similar images for an image.
  
  **Method 1 - Using Elasticsearch:** Here the user can select an image from the dropdown and show similar images based on the results returned from Elasticsearch.
  Here's the link for the app: [Similar images using dropdown](https://elasticsearch-heroku.herokuapp.com/)
  
  **Method 2 - Using image upload:** Using this app, user can upload an image and the app will run the spotify annoy algorithm to show the similar images.
  Here's the link for the app: [Similar images using image upload](http://52.41.232.196:8501/)
